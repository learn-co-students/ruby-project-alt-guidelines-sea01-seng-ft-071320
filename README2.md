    compute_average
    - look at all elements in Review

    - calculate the rating for every ice cream
    - get ice cream names (similar to the all_reviews_greater_than_number)



 - check if user already exist
        - if true ask if user wants to update the review or wants a new ice cream

   
        - get user input 
    - write some code

step 3
    - if user wants to create new ice cream

  #"Hi #{name}!"
#end
 
#puts "Enter your name:"
#users_name = gets.strip
 
#puts say_hello(users_name)
